        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p><strong>Hi, Iâ€™m Aditya Sandge ðŸ‘‹</strong></p>
        <p>Certified Health & Fitness Coach dedicated to helping busy professionals achieve sustainable fitness goals without compromising their lifestyle. With a tailored approach, I work with you one-on-one to create plans that genuinely fit your lifeâ€”because I believe health should support your lifestyle, not complicate it.</p>
        
        <h3>My Journey</h3>
        <p>With over 7 years in the fitness industry, I, like many, initially struggled to stay consistent. However, through years of research, training, and firsthand experience, I discovered that small, steady steps yield life-changing results. This journey not only transformed my health but ignited a passion for guiding others. Through consistent effort, I have earned the titles of Elite Powerlifter and an Calisthenic Athlete.</p>
        
        <h3>My Approach</h3>
        <p><strong>Realistic Goals:</strong><br> We work together to set manageable, realistic goals that fit your pace.<br><br>
           <strong>Holistic Wellness:</strong><br> Health is more than just workouts and diet; I also help with mindset, motivation, and lifestyle balance.<br> <br>
           <strong>Personalized Coaching:</strong> <br>No two people are the same. Thatâ€™s why every plan is uniquely designed to match your needs, preferences, and schedule.</p>
        
        <h3>Why Choose Me?</h3>
        <p>Iâ€™ve helped clients lose weight, boost energy, and gain confidenceâ€”all while fitting wellness into their already busy lives. My clients often say they feel seen, understood, and truly supported on this journey.</p>
